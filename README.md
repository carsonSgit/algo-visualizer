# Algo Visualizer

This project is made with a few purposes:

- AI use is expected in 2025, but overuse makes us lazy
    - **It's been about 3 years since I learnt data structures & algorithms**, I learnt them before GPT was released, so I want to make sure **that I'm not washed**
- I'm really tired of just building in Python/TS, so I want to branch out
    - **Zig** 
    - **Go**
